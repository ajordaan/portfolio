This project holds a special place in my heart. It was the first proper application I ever built, and it started out as a Java desktop app way back in 2014 to help my mom manage her Drama Academy students. Since then both the project and I have grown and changed a lot! 

The project now runs on rails, hosted on Fly.io, and has many more features. It has basic CRUD to allow principals to manage student and parent information, there are attendance registers that are filled out weekly by teachers to keep track of absentees. It also integrates with other services like Mailchimp for email campaigns and Xero for invoicing and tracking parent accounts.

Parents are able to signup their children online, and existing parents are able to re-enrol students who currently attend lesssons and would like to continue the following year. 

I have learn't a great deal from this project, aside from the technical skills I developed while builiding features, I also learn't about gathering requrements, evaluating the scope of features, managing my time between work and side projects.

I am quite proud of this project, and am excited to keep building and adding features.
